✅ Loading and inspecting the dataset.
✅ Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
✅ Feature scaling using **MinMaxScaler**.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Analyzing sales trends over time.
✅ Visualizing sales distribution using **Matplotlib**.
✅ Identifying key patterns and seasonality in sales data.

### 🤖 Machine Learning for Forecasting
✅ **Linear Regression Model** implementation for sales prediction.
✅ Model evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **R-squared Score**.
✅ Interpretation of model accuracy and forecasting performance.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
